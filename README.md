# Console-Finances

## Description

I designed and built my portfolio layout using Bootstrap CSS Framework.
This project is based on the concepts I have learned in Javascript fundamentals to address a real-world example. The task was to create code base for analysing the financial records of a company.

Skills utilised: psuedocoding, variables, for loops and if statements.
